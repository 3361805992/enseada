# Enseada
![logo](./.github/logo-white.png)

*A Cloud native multi-package registry*  

Enseada is a modern, fast and scalable package registry, designed from the ground up to run in elastic, container-based environments and to be highly available and distributed.

It leverages scalability by using natively distributed technologies

The registry itself is written in [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org), an [Erlang](https://www.erlang.org/) compatible,
functional and process-based programming language that is both fast and resource efficient.

[CouchDB](https://couchdb.apache.org/) is used as the primary datastore, containing information about
repositories, users and access control. CouchDB is a web-native database written in Erlang and based on web technologies
like HTTP and JSON.

As far as storage is concerned, both local disks an object storage services are supported, altough
the latter are strongly recommended for production deployments.

## Supported package repositories

Enseada is a multi-package registry, meaning it can support a large number of package 
formats and registry APIs.

At the moment, the following formats are supported:

- [Maven 2/3](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-repositories.html)
- [NPM](https://github.com/npm/registry/blob/master/docs/REGISTRY-API.md) (planned, coming soon)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/api/) (planned, coming soon)
- [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org) (planned, coming soon)

## Supported storage providers

Enseada uses the wonderful library [Waffle](https://github.com/stavro/arc) to implement
its storage layer, and is therefore compatible with any provider supported by Waffle.
See [Configuration](#configuration) for how to setup the storage layer.

At the moment, only these providers are supported:

- Local disk
- S3 compatible (AWS S3, Minio, DigitalOcean Spaces, Scaleway Object Storage, Ceph, etc)
- Google Cloud Storage

Local disk is only supported in single-node mode. To support [cluster mode](#cluster-mode) use an object storage provider.

## Run
Enseada is built with [Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org/), a powerful Elixir web framework.
When running from sources, Enseada can be started as any Phoenix application using Mix:
`mix phx.server`

When running from an Elixir release (see [build](#build)), it can be started from the control script:
`_build/prod/rel/enseada/bin/enseada start`

A local CouchDB instance can be started using the provided [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml) file.
Simply run `docker-compose up -d` to start it in background, it will be available on `http://localhost:5984` and will
persist data in a Docker volume.

Upon first run, the database server is uninitialized. Please run the initialization setup for 
single node deployment by visiting http://localhost:5984/_utils/#setup and following the instructions.

## Build
Enseada is packaged as an [Elixir release](https://hexdocs.pm/mix/Mix.Tasks.Release.html).
To build one for production, run `MIX_ENV=production mix release`.

Enseada is also packaged as a [Docker image](https://www.docker.com/). Build one with `docker build -t myname/enseada:latest .`

## Configuration
Enseada is primarily configured via environment variables. Here is a list of the supported configuration.
Variables without a default value are required.

### Application config
```.env
## Random generated value
SECRET_KEY_BASE

## Internet accessible hostname
PUBLIC_HOST

## Application port
PORT=4000

## Logger level (accepts debug, info, warn, error)
LOG_LEVEL=info

## Base URL to use when serving packages 
## e.g. ASSET_HOST=https://d3gav2egqolk5.cloudfront.net
ASSET_HOST=nil
```

### Database

```.env
## CouchDB server URL
COUCHDB_URL

## CouchDB server username
COUCHDB_USER=nil

## CouchDB server password
COUCHDB_PASSWORD=nil
```

### Storage

```.env
# Storage provider (accepts gcs, s3, local) 
STORAGE_PROVIDER=local
```

#### Local
```.env
# Storage directory
STORAGE_DIR=./uploads
```

#### S3
```.env
## S3 bucket name
AWS_S3_BUCKET

## S3 bucket region
AWS_REGION

## S3 client key ID (optional, defaults to instance role)
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=nil

## S3 client secret key (optional, defaults to instance role)
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=nil

## S3 HTTP endpoint (optional, defaults to Amazon S3 endpoints)
AWS_S3_ENDPOINT=nil

## Bucket keys prefix
BUCKET_PREFIX=uploads
```

#### GCS
```.env
## GCS bucket name
GCS_BUCKET

## GCS json credentials, alternative to GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS
GCS_JSON_CREDENTIALS

## Path to a GCP credentials json, alternative to GCS_JSON_CREDENTIALS 
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS

## Bucket keys prefix
BUCKET_PREFIX=uploads
```


## HTTPS support
Enseada has full support for strict HTTPS, enabling it is very simple.

Passing the environment value `SSL=yes|true|active` (or any kind of non-empty value) will turn on
HTTPS on the entire application (with [HSTS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security) enabled). This will require two
additional environment variables.

```.env
## The path to the key file
SSL_KEY_PATH=nil

## The path to the certificate file
SSL_CERT_PATH=nil
```

## Cluster mode
TBD
