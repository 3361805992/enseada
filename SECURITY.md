## Responsible disclosure security policy

A responsible disclosure policy helps protect users of the project from publicly disclosed security vulnerabilities without a fix by employing a process where vulnerabilities are first triaged in a private manner, and only publicly disclosed after a reasonable time period that allows patching the vulnerability and provides an upgrade path for users.

When contacting us directly via email, we will do our best efforts to respond in a reasonable time to resolve the issue.

We kindly ask you to refrain from malicious acts that put our users, the project, or any of the project’s team members at risk.

## Reporting a security issue

At Enseada, we consider the security of our systems a top priority. But no matter how much effort we put into system security, there can still be vulnerabilities present.

If you discover a security vulnerability, please use one of the following means of communications to report it to us:

* Report the security issue to the project maintainers directly at enseada@pm.me. If the report contains highly sensitive information, please be advised to encrypt your findings using our [PGP key](#pgp-key) which is also available in this document.

Your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings are sincerely appreciated and will be taken into account to acknowledge your contributions.
